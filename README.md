# L1000_DILI
Use transcriptomics from LINCS L1000 to predict drug-induced liver injury (DILI).

### Dataset
data.csv includes the training and validation data set
testing.csv is only used for testing the optimized model.

### Methods
In the conventional_models, We use three KNN, SVM and RF to predict DILI.
In the DNN, we use a fully connected deep neural network to predict DILI.
